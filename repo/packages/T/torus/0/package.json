  "description": "Torus is an open source project for distributed storage coordinated through etcd.\n\nTorus provides a resource pool and basic file primitives from a set of daemons running atop multiple nodes. These primitives are made consistent by being append-only and coordinated by etcd. From these primitives, a Torus server can support multiple types of volumes, the semantics of which can be broken into subprojects. It ships with a simple block-device volume plugin, but is extensible to more.",
