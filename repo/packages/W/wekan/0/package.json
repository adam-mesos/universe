  "preInstallNotes": "WARNING: Wekan on DCOS is currently EXPERIMENTAL. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\nThis package can create local persistent volumes for internal storage files to survive across restarts or failures. Select `Advanced Installation` and check out the `storage` section for details. Also, this package can use a local volume in the host for storage, like a local directory or an NFS mount. The parameter `host_volume` controls the path in the host in which these volumes will be created, which MUST be the same on all nodes of the cluster. If you didn't select `persistence` in the storage section, or provided a valid value for `host_volume` on installation,\nYOUR DATA WILL NOT BE SAVED IN ANY WAY.\nIf the `external_access` installation option is selected, this package will also create an entry in the External Load Balancer for accessing the service from outside of the cluster on port `11201` by default.",
  "postInstallNotes": "Wekan has been installed. You can access Wekan from the Services tab, or in your public node if you selected `external_access` on installation.",
  "postUninstallNotes": "Wekan has been uninstalled. Note that any data persisted to a NFS share still exists and will need to be manually removed.",
