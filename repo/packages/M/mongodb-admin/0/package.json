  "preInstallNotes": "In order for MongoDB Admin service to start successfully it requires atleast 0.3 CPU and 256MB of RAM. WARNING: MongoDB Admin on DCOS is currently EXPERIMENTAL. There may be bugs, incomplete\nfeatures, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\nIf the `external_access` installation option is selected, this package creates an entry in the External Load Balancer for accessing the service from outside of the cluster on port `27018` by default.\n\nSecurity Notice: JSON documents are parsed through a javascript virtual machine, so the web interface can be used for executing malicious javascript on a server. MongoDB Admin should only be used privately for development purposes.\n\nIn order to use in conjunction with the DC/OS mongodb package, please connect to the server `mongodb.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory'",
